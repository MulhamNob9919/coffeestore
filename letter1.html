"Well well well..<br><br>
its been 15 months aka. 1 year and 3 months.<br><br>
I never thought you'd truly take me or this relationship seriously, and in some ways, I still don't. I don't believe your patience can handle someone like me. I'm overprotective, overly jealous, I'm over everything. I don’t like that about myself, but it’s who I am.<br><br>

We've had some tough days, especially last month, which we didn't even celebrate. Both of us were so stressed. You had school, stepbrother issues, chores, tutoring etc. I don’t blame you that's a lot to deal with. Meanwhile, I had school too, but the time zone difference made it feel even harder to text.<br><br>

I want to address some things that have come between us, starting with why I’ve been suspicious lately:<br><br>

Why Have I Been Suspecting You?<br>
You’ve suddenly stopped certain habits, which has thrown me off. For example:
<br><br>
-Taking Proof of Everything: You used to send me photos of almost everything—your stepbrother, dad, anything going on in your life. But you stopped once the stepbrother situation started stressing you out.<br><br>

-(Video) Calling: It feels like video calls have become a reward I get only when I’ve done something “good.” We barely call anymore, and when we do, it’s for five minutes before you have to hang up, saying it’s your mom or dad.
<br><br><br>
I get that you don’t have to do these things every day, but to stop them so suddenly? When I asked, you apologized without giving me a real explanation. I understand your stepbrother is moving in and that is stressing you, but it still hurts. Honestly, it feels like being shot in the chest when you prioritize him that much. It really does hurt bad.<br><br>


I know I have my own flaws too. Lately, I’ve been cold, dry, lazy, just not the Mulham i used to be. All I want to do is sleep, but no matter how much I rest, I’m always tired. We have math and lectures daily, which adds to the exhaustion. You work harder than I do, and I get that. i have never worked like you since i was 9, and it’s tiring me up. I admire how you handle it all, even though I’m older than you. You're incredibly strong (all of it; mentally, physically and emotionally), and I respect you for that. whether it's your maturity, work, or even your culture, which people sometimes mock. To me, you're like a mom, and I often find myself turning to ask you you before my own mother which is a proof that i also see you like my mom.<br><br>


Riddhi, I promise you that I do <b>LOVE</b> you. I’m just a dumb guy who doesn’t have the emotional capacity like you do. I’ve always been trying to step forward to become someone more like you. You are without a doubt the best woman I will ever meet whether in this lifetime or the next one, and I don’t say that to comfort you about your past. I need you. <b>You’re the only one who completes me</b>, and without you, I’m just another boy like a feather in the wind, drifting randomly until I fall and disappear then get forgotten with time by turning into dust.<br><br>

And yes, I used ChatGPT because my English isn't the best. (this was also written by ChatGPT)<br>
<b>I love you, Riddhi</b>. Happy 14-month anniversary."<br>
